# Digital Stopwatch using FPGA and VHDL

This is the project Nhut Do and Brendan Han built in their course ECE 287 - Digital System Design
We have created a Digital Stopwatch by incorporating the Altera DE2-115 FPGA board with VHDL. The stopwatch can display up to 59:59:59 value and is controlled with the 3 push buttons which corresponds to start, stop, and reset.

This is the demo video from our project.
